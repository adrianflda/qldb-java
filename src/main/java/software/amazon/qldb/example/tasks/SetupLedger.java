/**
 * The purpose of this class is to show how a ledger can be setup using the QLDB java driver.
 * We use three actions  to do that:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>CreateLedger</li>
 *     <li>DescribeLedger</li>
 *     <li>ListLedgers</li>
 * </ol>
 * We first issue a CreateLedger query to QLDB, which starts the ledger creation process. At this point of time,
 * the status of the ledger will be  "CREATING" as QLDB takes short amount of time to create the ledger.
 *
 * In Order to confirm if the ledger creation is complete, we poll QLDB via DescribeLedger Query at a fixed interval
 * and check if the Status has changed to Active. Once the status has changed to ACTIVE, we are sure that the ledger
 * creation has succeeded.
 *
 * Finally, We use the ListLedgers query to log all the ledgers we have created up until now.
