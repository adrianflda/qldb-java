/**
 * <p>
 * This is a single place to manage all the interactions with the QLDB Driver.
 * The class takes care of injecting the correct driver, getting the session
 * from the driver, issuing the execute method of the session and handling the
 * exceptions coming due to bad sessions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All the classes in the application which require to interact with QLDB
 * inject the TransactionHandler as a dependency and then just use
 * "executeTransaction" method. This gives two advantages:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li> All the other classes are freed from the responsibility of managing
 *     the driver and sessions </li>
 *
 *     <li> It becomes easier to debug and maintain the interactions with QLDB
 *     driver, since it resides only in TransactionHandler</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note: This is just one of the patterns that can be used in production.
